# Roo Code Memory Bank Package Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the implementation of the Roo Code Memory Bank packages for both NPM and NuGet ecosystems.

## Overview

We've created a complete implementation for distributing Cline configuration files as packages for both NPM (JavaScript/Node.js) and NuGet (.NET) ecosystems. These packages automatically extract configuration files to the root of consuming projects during installation or build.

## Implementation Details

### NPM Package

The NPM package uses a postinstall script to extract configuration files to the root of the consuming project during installation. Key features include:

- **Automatic extraction** during `npm install`
- **Manual extraction** via `npx cline-rules-extract`
- **Programmatic API** for custom extraction
- **Preservation of existing files** to avoid overwriting local modifications
- **Bundled configuration files** to ensure consistent distribution and installation

The NPM package bundles the configuration files (.clinerules-* and .roo directory) within the package itself and extracts them to the consuming project during installation. This ensures consistent distribution and installation across different environments.

### NuGet Package

The NuGet package uses MSBuild targets to extract configuration files to the root of the consuming project during build. Key features include:

- **Automatic extraction** during project build
- **Integration with MSBuild pipeline**
- **Preservation of existing files** to avoid overwriting local modifications

## Testing

Both packages include test scripts to verify the extraction functionality:

- **NPM Package**: `npm test` runs a script that extracts files from the repository root to a test directory
- **NuGet Package**: PowerShell and Bash scripts that create a test project and install the package

## Usage

### NPM Package

```bash
# Install the package
npm install @automateeverything.cc/roo-code-memory-bank

# Manual extraction
npx cline-rules-extract

# Programmatic use
const clinerRules = require('@automateeverything.cc/roo-code-memory-bank');
clinerRules.extractConfigFiles();
```

### NuGet Package

```bash
# Install the package
dotnet add package RooCodeMemoryBank

# The files will be extracted during build
dotnet build
```

## Versioning

Both packages follow semantic versioning:

- **Patch version** (1.0.x): For minor changes or corrections
- **Minor version** (1.x.0): For new features or non-breaking changes
- **Major version** (x.0.0): For breaking changes

## Publishing

### Manual Publishing

#### NPM Package

```bash
cd package-tools/npm-package
npm publish --access public
```

#### NuGet Package

```bash
cd package-tools/nuget-package
dotnet pack -c Release
dotnet nuget push bin/Release/RooCodeMemoryBank.1.0.0.nupkg -k YOUR_API_KEY -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
```

### Automated Publishing with GitHub Actions

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that automate the building, testing, and publishing of both packages:

#### Workflow Files

- **Main Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-packages.yml`): 
  - Runs on main branch, pull requests, and releases
  - Full testing on multiple platforms and runtime versions
  - Handles publishing on release

- **Development Workflow** (`.github/workflows/dev-builds.yml`):
  - Runs on all branches except main
  - Lightweight testing for faster feedback
  - Creates artifacts but doesn't publish

These workflows provide the following features:

- **Continuous Integration**: Builds and tests both packages on multiple operating systems and runtime versions
- **Artifact Generation**: Creates package artifacts for each build configuration
- **Automated Publishing**: Publishes packages to NPM and NuGet when a GitHub release is created
- **Documentation Updates**: Automatically updates version references in documentation files

## Build Types

Different build types are available:

- **Release builds**: When a GitHub release is created (tag: latest)
- **Beta builds**: When code is pushed to the main branch (tag: beta)
- **Nightly builds**: From daily scheduled runs (tag: nightly)
- **PR builds**: When a PR is opened against main (tag: pr-{number})
- **Branch builds**: When code is pushed to non-main branches (tag: dev-{branch-name})

The workflows run automatically on:
- Push to any branch except main (development builds via dev-builds.yml)
- Push to main branch (via build-packages.yml)
- Pull requests to the main branch (via build-packages.yml)
- Creation of a new release (via build-packages.yml)

To use the GitHub Actions workflow for publishing:

1. Set up the required secrets in your GitHub repository:
   - `NPM_TOKEN`: Your NPM authentication token
   - `NUGET_API_KEY`: Your NuGet API key

2. Create a new release in GitHub with the appropriate version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

3. The workflow will automatically build, test, and publish both packages to their respective registries

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust solution for distributing Cline configuration files to projects in both JavaScript/Node.js and .NET ecosystems. The packages are designed to be easy to use, maintain, and update, with a focus on preserving local modifications and providing clear documentation. The included GitHub Actions workflows further streamline the development and release process, ensuring consistent builds and automated publishing for both production and development environments.

## Recent Updates

### NPM Package Implementation Changes

We've updated the NPM package implementation to address the following requirements:

1. The package now bundles the `.clinerules-*` files and `.roo` directory from the repository root
2. When the package is consumed, it extracts these files to the root of the consuming project, overwriting existing files

Key changes include:

- Updated package.json to include the configuration files in the published package
- Added a prepare script to copy the configuration files from the repository root to the package directory before publishing
- Modified the extract-config.js script to copy files from the package directory instead of the repository root
- See the detailed [Implementation Plan](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for more information

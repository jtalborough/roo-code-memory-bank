## Implementation Details

### NPM Package

1. **Package Configuration**
   - The package is configured in `package.json`
   - It includes a `postinstall` script that runs `extract-config.js`
   - Dependencies include `fs-extra` for enhanced file operations

2. **Extraction Script**
   - Located at `scripts/extract-config.js`
   - Uses Node.js file system operations to copy files
   - Implements conflict resolution by backing up existing files
   - Handles both individual files and directories
   - Skips extraction in CI environments to avoid issues

3. **File Selection**
   - The `files` field in `package.json` specifies which files to include
   - `.npmignore` specifies which files to exclude

### NuGet Package

1. **Package Configuration**
   - The package is configured in `ClinerRules.nuspec`
   - It specifies content files and build targets

2. **Build Targets**
   - Located at `build/ClinerRules.targets`
   - Uses MSBuild tasks to copy files during the build process
   - Implements conflict resolution by backing up existing files
   - Handles both individual files and directories

3. **File Selection**
   - The `files` element in `ClinerRules.nuspec` specifies which files to include

## Extraction Process

### NPM Extraction

1. The `postinstall` script runs automatically after package installation
2. The script determines the package root and project root
3. It skips extraction in CI environments or when installed as a dependency
4. For each configuration file:
   - It checks if the file already exists in the project root
   - If it exists, it creates a backup with a timestamp suffix
   - It copies the file from the package to the project root
5. For the `.roo` directory:
   - It recursively copies files, handling conflicts for each file

### NuGet Extraction

1. The MSBuild target runs during the build process
2. It defines source and destination paths for files
3. For each configuration file:
   - It checks if the file already exists in the project root
   - If it exists, it creates a backup with a timestamp suffix
   - It copies the file from the package to the project root
4. For the `.roo` directory:
   - It creates the directory if it doesn't exist
   - It recursively copies files, handling conflicts for each file

## Conflict Resolution

Both implementations use a similar approach to conflict resolution:

1. **File Backup**
   - Existing files are backed up with a timestamp suffix
   - This preserves the user's existing configuration

2. **Directory Handling**
   - For directories, files are copied individually
   - This preserves files in the directory that aren't part of the package

3. **Logging**
   - Both implementations log their actions
   - This helps users understand what files were copied or backed up

## Versioning Strategy

The versioning strategy follows semantic versioning:

1. **Major Version Changes**
   - Breaking changes to configuration format
   - Removal of configuration files
   - Significant changes to system prompts that alter behavior

2. **Minor Version Changes**
   - Addition of new configuration files
   - New features in existing configuration files
   - Non-breaking enhancements to system prompts

3. **Patch Version Changes**
   - Bug fixes in configuration files
   - Minor text corrections
   - Performance improvements

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Interactive Mode**
   - Allow users to choose which files to extract
   - Provide diff view of changes before extraction

2. **Configuration Options**
   - Allow users to configure extraction behavior
   - Support for custom file locations

3. **Validation**
   - Validate configuration files before extraction
   - Ensure compatibility with the current version of Roo's CLI assistant
